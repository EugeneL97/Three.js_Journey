# Three.js_Journey

Welcome to my traversal through Bruno Simon's Three.js course. I’ve always had a passion for media arts since high school, whether it was drawing, animating, 3D modeling, or creating short films. For a while, I focused more on back-end development and hammering my coding fundamentals, but now I’m excited to merge my coding expertise with my creative side. This repository is where I’ll document my projects and progress, and it helps me stay organized as I work between two computers. Feel free to follow along, and let me know if you have any suggestions for projects!
